Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where &quot;adjacent&quot; cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

Example:


board =
[
  [&#39;A&#39;,&#39;B&#39;,&#39;C&#39;,&#39;E&#39;],
  [&#39;S&#39;,&#39;F&#39;,&#39;C&#39;,&#39;S&#39;],
  [&#39;A&#39;,&#39;D&#39;,&#39;E&#39;,&#39;E&#39;]
]

Given word = &quot;ABCCED&quot;, return true.
Given word = &quot;SEE&quot;, return true.
Given word = &quot;ABCB&quot;, return false.
